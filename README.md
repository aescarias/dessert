# Dessert

Dessert (short for Deserialize/Serialize Transforms) is a DSL for describing data formats. It aims to be a simple yet powerful language combining the power of regular expressions with the familiarity of standard data types to produce parsers or interpreters for practically any format.

The current documentation available is the [Dessert Language Specification](./docs/SPEC-0.1.adoc).
