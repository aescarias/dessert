== Functions

=== `seek(offset, whence)`

`seek` performs a seeking operation on the currently active file object.

`offset` is an integer specifying the relative byte offset from which to seek.

`whence` is a string specifying the position relative to which the byte offset will be calculated. `whence` must be either of the following strings:

- `start` means the byte offset is relative to the start of the file.
- `end` means the byte offset is relative to the end of the file.
- `current` means the byte offset is relative to the current position within the file.

`seek` returns an integer specifying the absolute byte offset (that is, relative to byte 0) from which the next byte will be read.
